# Blog Card Component

This repository contains the code for a Blog Card Component, which is a responsive and interactive UI element designed to showcase a blog post with an image, title, category, description, and user details. This project is inspired by a challenge provided by [FrontendPro](https://www.frontendpro.dev/frontend-coding-challenges/blog-card-component-bBI5CtACFbEmwqF4LHJU).

- **User Details**: Displays the author's profile image, name, and the time since the blog was posted.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the component.
